# Relievely

This repository includes every microservice and the frontend that is needed to run the app

## Setup

In this project we have multiple microservices that are written with TypeScript
to run start the local development server with that you have to first install the
correct tools for that.

So start with installing ts-node-dev globally, so you can use it in your CLI

```shell
npm install -g ts-node-dev
```
